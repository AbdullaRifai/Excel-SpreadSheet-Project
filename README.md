# Excel-SpreadSheet-Projects

First Project: Invoice System

I have made a table where the user can enter the quantity and the unit price of multiple items and a discount of 3% is automatically applied when the quantity exceeds 20 items. The sale price (which might be different than the list price depending on if the 3% has been applied or not) is automatically calculated for each item, as well as the total for that item(quantity * Sale price) (automatically). Then the subtotal is given as well as the GST/HST. Finally the total is the sum of subtotal and the GST/HST.

Second Project: Employee Payroll System

I have made a table where we have employees in a company who get paid wages depending on their hours. If the hours the employee spends are between 44-50 they get overtime wage (regular wage * 1.5). If they worked over 50 hours they get the one and half pay for the 6 hours as well as the double the pay for anything above 50 hours. Regular pay is applied for anything less than 44 hours. 

Third Project: Movie Rankings

We have a list of movies with rankings, rating, title, year, genres and director. From this list we can enter the rank in the field provided and that will retrieve from this list the movie specifications (using VLOOKUP). the user can change anything in the movie list and that would directly affect what we see in the lookup table. 

Fourth Project: Insurance Premium Disturbution

Depending on the total insurance premium as well as the number of seats allocated for each location we distribute the premium. The percent of total seats is automatically calculated and the permium allocated changes according to that calculated %. In addition, whenever the percentages of seats held by each location changes I display that change in a pie chart that dynamically displays that change. This feature is important because visualizing the distribution can lead to better decision making. 

Reasons why I believe Excel SpreadSheet is useful: 

I believe although these tasks can be done by hand or by using writing tools for small input sets, this cannot be done for big inputs without using these functions. Automating this tasks can also help increase productivity as well as cutback on redundant tasks by reusing the same components for other similar tasks. 

Hope this showcases my knowledge in Excel functions and how they are used. 

Thank you for reading this, I have included the file in this repository.
